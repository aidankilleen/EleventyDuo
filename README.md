Files in `assets` will be handled by webpack.

Eleventy will transform files in `data`, `layout` and `includes` directories, and will copy across any `images`.

Eleventyâ€™s output will be to a `public` directory at the root level.

## Customize

This file contains your site title and author details and can be used to store any other commonly used site data.

```json

  "name": "Eleventy Duo",
  "description": "Eleventy Duo is a production-ready and  SEO-friendly starter for building a blog or personal website. Comes with a customizable duotone theme, minimal and clean design.",

  "author": {
    "name": "Author Name",
    "email": "author@site.com",
    "twitterHandle": "author_handle"
  },
  "socialImage": "/images/social-image.jpg"
}
```
